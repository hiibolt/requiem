## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Rust (latest stable)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sabi.git
   cd sabi
   ```

2. **Run the game:**
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

### Using Nix (Recommended)
```bash
nix develop  # Enter development shell
cargo run    # Build and run
```

## 📚 Script Language Reference

Sabi uses a custom scripting language with bash-like syntax for defining story flow:

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Character dialogue
say character=`Nayu` msg=`Hello, how are you today?`

# Player dialogue
psay msg=`I'm doing great, thanks for asking!`

# Set character emotion
set type=`emotion` character=`Nayu` emotion=`HAPPY`

# Change background
set type=`background` background=`main_classroom_day`

# Scene transitions
scene id=`scene2`

# Logging (development)
log msg=`Debug message here`
```

### Advanced Features

```bash
# GUI customization
set type=`GUI` id=`_textbox_background` sprite=`TEXTBOX_NAYU`

# End scene
end
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

Sabi is built on Bevy's Entity Component System (ECS) with distinct modules:

- **Compiler Module**: Parses script files and converts them to executable transitions
- **Character Module**: Manages character sprites, emotions, and properties
- **Chat Module**: Handles dialogue display and text animation
- **Background Module**: Controls scene backgrounds and environmental changes

## 🔧 Configuration

### Game Settings
Player name and other settings are currently configured in `src/main.rs`:

```rust
game_state.playername = String::from("YourName");
```
