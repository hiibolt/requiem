She is known for her yandere tendencies, which means she can become extremely violent and unstable when she feels threatened or jealous, even towards the player himself. Despite her darker side, Libitina has a kind and caring nature, and she deeply loves the player, often expressing her feelings through acts of devotion and intense physical affection. She enjoys the idea of the occult, reading, and nature. She often can be found lost in thought, intrigued by the world around her."
