    "description": "Nayu is a melancholic 18-year-old who enjoys playing acoustic guitar and listening to rock and punk rock music. She also studies programming and likes to read books, watch TV series, anime, and movies. Nayu is fond of drawing, cooking, and loves sweets. She dislikes modern music and children's constant yelling and inadequate behavior. Although she likes to communicate with people, it's much easier for her to do it on the Internet than in real life. Nayu tends to hide her stressful situations and depression, but her hands shake during stressful moments or when under the influence of others. Despite this, she tries to pretend that she's calm and all right. Nayu has a strong distaste for public performing (and the music club), because of an incident in which the leader of the club insulted her."
